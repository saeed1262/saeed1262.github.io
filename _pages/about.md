I am a Research Scientist at [Amazon Games](https://www.amazongames.com/en-us), specializing in **machine learning**, **computer vision**, **computer graphics**, and **computer animation**. Previously, I worked as an R&D Scientist at [Ubisoft La Forge](https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/our-engagements/research-and-development/), where I contributed to cutting-edge research in motion synthesis and gesture generation.

I earned my PhD from [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/), where I was a trainee with both the [VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/) and [CVR](https://cvr.yorku.ca/) programs. My research focuses on developing **novel deep probabilistic models** for realistic human motion modeling, with applications in character animation, pose estimation, and gesture synthesis.

## Research Interests

- **Human Motion Modeling**: Probabilistic frameworks for character animation
- **Gesture Generation**: Zero-shot example-based gesture synthesis from speech
- **Pose Estimation**: Multi-view 3D human pose estimation with uncertainty quantification
- **Computer Vision**: Deep learning applications in motion capture and analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Variational autoencoders and hierarchical latent variable models
