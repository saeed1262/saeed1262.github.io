I am a Research Scientist at [Amazon Games](https://www.amazongames.com/en-us), specializing in machine learning, computer vision, computer graphics, and computer animation. Previously, I worked as an R&D Scientist at Ubisoft La Forge. I earned my PhD from York University, where I was a trainee with both the VISTA and CVR programs. My current research focuses on developing novel deep probabilistic models for realistic human motion modeling.
