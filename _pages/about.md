I am an R&D Scientist at [Ubisoft La Forge](https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/our-engagements/research-and-development/), Toronto.
I did my PhD at York University, advised by [Dr. Niko Troje](https://www.biomotionlab.ca/niko-troje/) where I was also a [VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/) and [CVR](http://www.cvr.yorku.ca/) trainee. My research interests are machine learning, computer vision, computer graphics, and computer animation. My current research focus is on leveraging novel deep probabilistic models for realistic human motion modelling.
