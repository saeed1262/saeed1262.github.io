I have joined [Amazon Games](https://www.amazongames.com/en-us) as a Research Scientist.

This role allows me to continue working on AI-driven character animation and motion synthesis while applying research to gaming applications.

**Focus Areas at Amazon Games:**
- Machine learning models for character animation
- Real-time motion synthesis for interactive entertainment
- Motion capture and analysis systems
- Collaboration with development teams to integrate research

I look forward to contributing to Amazon Games' development of gaming experiences through research and technology innovation.

The transition from academic to industry research provides opportunities to apply research to products with broad user impact.
